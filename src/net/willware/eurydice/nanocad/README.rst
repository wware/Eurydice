NanoCAD
=======

A lot of this code came from the NanoCAD Java applet that I wrote in 1997, at
a time when my Java chops were less fully developed, and my understanding of
molecular modeling was shallower than it is now. NanoCAD worked well for tiny
little structures, but even at the time I knew it wouldn't scale to a thousand
atoms nicely. To build a structure the user needed to use the mouse to draw
bonds from one atom to another.

The code in the *net.willware.eurydice.nanocad* package is included for
historical reasons. I've adapted it to the Eurydice framework but I haven't
bothered to do everything required to make it functional, as I am primarily
focused on a more modern web app, and NanoCAD is primarily of historical value
at this point.
