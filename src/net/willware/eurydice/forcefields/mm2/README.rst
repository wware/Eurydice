This MM2 implementation is taken from Section 3.3 and particularly Section 3.3.2 of
*Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation* by K. Eric Drexler,
copyright 1992, published by John Wiley and Sons. It was used in the 1997 NanoCAD applet.
It has not received any formal review and should not be considered for serious work, but
is nevertheless useful for introductory studies in stereochemistry and thermal motion.
